# Digit-recognizer-with-pytorch
Handwritten symbol recognition helps digitize handwritten documents for efficient storage.
The image quality or contrast between the drawing and background may not be good enough.
The amount of data to process grows daily.
We need data-handling methods.
Deep residual Neural Networks can efficiently train deep networks, so we proposed them.
ResNet-18 was trained on 25 classes of handwritten math symbols.
